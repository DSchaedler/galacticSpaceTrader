*Oh, so much to do~.*

Determine what end products are craftable\
Determine what materials are required for those products\
Determine what elements are required for those materials\
\
Have planets produce elements at random rates.\
Set a cap for how much a planet can store total.\
Have asteroids produce elements at random rates.\
\
set a cap for how much an asteroid can store total\
\
Have factories convert materials/elements on their planet/space-station to chosen end products/materials\
Factories stop producing once materials run out\
Factories on planets will not convert if the product is worth less than it's components at local prices.\
\
Ship automatically converts some recipes, like Air, consuming any available resources\
