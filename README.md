Look. I'm not a lawyer. If you are one, there's a license on this code, the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. This is the version that I thought best protected the code in this repository.

If you're not a lawyer, here's what I ask of you.

1. If I'm selling this game, please buy a copy. It really helps me out.
2. If I'm not selling this game, please don't sell this game. It's rude to make money from someone else's work.
3. If you can't buy a copy, you can use this source code to compile a copy. You can pay me by sharing the link to where I'm selling it with your friends.

This code is designed for the Dragonruby Game Tool Kit, which is owned by someone else and protected under copyright. I've done my best to exclude their property from this repository, but if there's some hiding in here, it's illegal to download, sell, distribute or do other protected acts with their code.
